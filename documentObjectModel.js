// ðŸŒ³ What is the DOM?
// DOM stands for Document Object Model.
// When a web page loads, the browser takes the HTML code and turns it into a tree-like structure that JavaScript can interact with.
// This structure is called the DOM tree.
// Think of the DOM as a bridge between your HTML page and JavaScript.
